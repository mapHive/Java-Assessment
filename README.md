Java Assessment

Reflection Questions:
What did you like about this project?

Despite being a challenge to connect all the dots, it was useful to work with numerous files and try to conceptualise the links between things in my head. 

What did you struggle with in this project?

It was hard to keep the links and relationships clear in my head as I was going through it. A lot of revisinting and reconceptualising was required. There comes a point it can be overwhelming and the mind just wants to stop tracking things, that's where I need more persistence.

What would make your experience with this assessment better?

A more gradual approach before getting to this assessment. For example doing five or six practices, starting off with very simple connections within composites and between classes, and graduating each exercise by a small degree of complexity so we get more exposure and digestion of learning until we reach something like what we were assessed on.
